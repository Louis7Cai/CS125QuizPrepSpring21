# Conceptual Overview

### Types
      * All data in java is a combination of the primitive types
      * Integer values: byte, short, int, and long
      * Floating point values: float and double
      * Boolean values: boolean
      * Characters: char
   <br></br>

      * Why Types?
         * Pros
            * You will be sure what type of data is in every variable
         * Cons
            * There are rules for variables, they are not flexible

    int oof = 7.2;
   <details>
   <summary>Spoiler!</summary>
      
         We have declared a variable of type int. However we have set it equal to 7.2. 
         Unlike doubles an int is not capabale of having decimals. So it will be equal to 7.
